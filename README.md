# This is simply a site developed out of personal need
I only wanted to publish it because of the need for free and immediate hosting. This site is non-profit of course. The site is free, you can copy it, distribute it and improve it as much as you want, honestly it is a very basic version and could be improved in many ways. I invite you to do so.
I have used old-style HTML, CSS and JS, without integrating frameworks such as React simply because of my inexperience.

# ðŸ¤– AI Written website
This site was designed entirely by myself on Figma. However, in order to experiment, I wanted to see if AI was able to replicate it, so I relied on GPT-4o for the description of the slides in Figma and then had O1 implement them. Finally, thanks to Deepseek-R1 I wrote the Javascript logic behind it.
